# Method      |	    Description
# close()	        Close an open file. It has no effect if the file is already closed.
# detach()	        Separate the underlying binary buffer from the TextIOBase and return it.
# fileno()	        Return an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.
# flush()	        Flush the write buffer of the file stream.
# isatty()	        Return True if the file stream is interactive.
# read(n)	        Read atmost n characters form the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or None.
# readable()	    Returns True if the file stream can be read from.
# readline(n=-1)	Read and return one line from the file. Reads in at most n bytes if specified.
# readlines(n=-1)	Read and return a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most n bytes/characters if specified.
# seek(offset,from=SEEK_SET)	Change the file position to offset bytes, in reference to from (start, current, end).
# seekable()	    Returns True if the file stream supports random access.
# tell()	        Returns the current file location.
# truncate(size=None)	Resize the file stream to size bytes. If size is not specified, resize to current location.
# writable()	    Returns True if the file stream can be written to.
# write(s)	        Write string s to the file and return the number of characters written.
# writelines(lines)	Write a list of lines to the file.
